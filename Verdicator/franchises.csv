The fact that BioWare chose to include downloadable content, including a new character and side quest, on launch day proves that they have an extensive plan for supporting the game. Couple that with the fact that each character can be developed in radically different ways, and you have an adventure that earns its own place among BioWare's expansive RPG collection. While the visuals are a bit underwhelming and the difficulty is a bit easier on the consoles, this is still a great title.

a quick crossover from PSX not because there were truly unique things 
to add to it on the platform, but because it was possible, and it could 
make a quick buck to release DQIV (and soon V and VI) to the fan base 
again.  With most players new to the look and feel though, the hybrid 
2D/3D design will be a fresh take on the series.  It's just a shame that 
there isn't more to the package.  DS players get a new Chance 
Encounter mode (similar to Bark Mode in Nintendogs) where a specific 
custom town is created for players, allowing you to trade items with 
other Chance Encounter DS units.  We don't see a lot of people using it 
in its intended design though (Bark Mode wasn't even popular enough 
to really be effective), or more than anything else it'll be a mode that 
you'll use when you already find someone with the game, and just want 
to tinker around between systems and swap a few goodies.  There's no 
online, no real DS-specific additions to the story or structure of the 
game (the prologue and Chapter 6 from PSX remain though), with the 
game even ignoring touch support for menus or battle. Random.  

Dragon Quest fans may still want to plop down the cash, as it's a great 
nostalgic package for those that haven't spent time with the Japanese 
remake on the original PSX, and for those itching to get into the series, 
it won't get much better than Chapters of the Chosen.  More could have 
been done with it though, and the end result is a product that still 
feels very archaic when compared to the other RPG offerings on DS, but 
one that is fun to play despite its flaws.  It can be inspired at times, and 
rough at others.  With a core game that's this strong though, you'll still 
find plenty of great gameplay to be had.  It's just a shame that it isn't 
on the level of the Final Fantasy remakes.","Captivating, uniquely presented storyline. Impressive dual-screen presentation. Detailed sprites and 3D environments.

Combining some impressive 3D work on the DS with over 200 collectable monsters, a lack of the somewhat irritating random dungeon generator, far more depth and production value overall, and impressive depth in a monster battler, Joker is a great chance for the more niche RPG gamers on DS to dive into the Monsters series for the first time and see for themselves what all the fuss is about.  It’s far from perfect though, as the game is essentially more of the same for the series, and ends up cutting a few corners to squeeze it all in, specifically when looking at monster diversity (change the color palate, give it a new name), a somewhat basic interface, and some technical limits in 3D draw distance and world geometry.  Those expecting a product with the overall polish, scope, and grandeur of the Pokemon series may be let down. That being said, DQM is easily worth the cash for monster battlers that are looking for a new game to latch onto after Nintendo’s first party effort grows stale, as it’s more ambitious technically, has a stronger battle mechanic, and brings monster battle customization to whole new level on DS.",Wonderful visual style.

By extension, that means that Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride is also a must-play RPG, though I can’t help but wish we were getting it sooner than 17 years late, and with a bit more fanfare and polish.  The core game is simply incredible, offering some of the best story, gameplay, and customization available in the Super NES era, and most of the DQ series to boot.  The DS version is the only one we’ve got, and while I wouldn’t go as far as to call it the definitive version without having a chance to experience the original, the updated script is very well done, things like the fan-missed party chat option (removed from DQIV on DS) is now back, and the sheer amount of impressive gameplay found in the nearly doubled in size monster battle system is immense.  The 3D design is great, the presentation is top notch, holding up what was originally done with the Super Famicom version and amplified by the PS2 remake in Japan.  There are still issues with the game as a current-day DS title though, such a very plain interface, a bland top screen during battles, and an archaic menu system that really makes the game feel dated.  The source material for this one is nothing short of amazing, and hands-down one of the best classic RPGs ever created.  The DS conversion of that source material – while still very commendable – could have been even better after seeing some of Square’s other works on the platform.  With that being said, DQV: Hand of the Heavenly Bride is a must-own game for anyone that calls themselves an RPG fan – it’s just that good.",Satisfying plot that has stood the test of time.

With that being said, the easy purchase isn’t found on Nintendo’s console, but on DS, where the intended touch control, two screen presentation, on-the-go local and online gaming, and audio/visual offering is at the top of the system’s library, and not lost in the shuffle.  On Wii you’re getting an emulation of the same game, though with no visual upgrades, tacked on IR control, the ability to take your character to a friend’s system locked out (except on Wi-Fi), and an overall lackluster port over it doesn’t seem worth it.  If the Wii offering was a cheaper WiiWare program that let you play DS games on your Wii (or even just this DS game on your Wii), I’d be all for it.  At full price, however, and with a lackluster control scheme to boot, there’s just no reason to play this one on consoles.  It’s obvious that Square Enix is trying to fill a gap in its Wii library, and is justifying the DS port by adding in crossover support.  If you own both systems, buy Echoes of Time for DS, and wait for the real Crystal Chronicles Wii game which is hitting later down the line.  The concept of a DS-to-Wii connected game is one that needs to be done, but more than that, it needs to be done right.

What do I think? Hm...Grand Theft Auto III? It's OK. Ha ha. Just kidding. Rockstar has been very gracious to us about covering its game exclusively, and if they hadn't ever been so nice to us, it would not have changed my mind about how I feel about the game. The game is absolutely, insanely good, and is truly one of the best titles of the year, on PlayStation 2, or on any system. Hm...sounds like I've been saying that a lot this year (Devil May Cry, Twisted Metal Black, Silent Hill 2); that's because unlike last year, this year, it's really happening. It's genuinely true.  

I never liked Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 much because I got stuck up on little mechanical things, and I was never a big fan of the top-down approach. But with this game, with what DMA has done to it, I'm hard pressed to say that there's anything not entirely loveable about it. And guess what, DMA fixed even the slightest little disturbance I had with GTA1 and GTA2 (getting stuck in a car in a corner, only being able to get in or out from one side), among many other things it fixed for this last effort. The game is so big, so relentlessly deep, and so various, that gamers who buy it will easily -- easily -- be playing it for more than 50 hours the first time through. And that's not even getting every little last item. For that, I'd say it's at least about an 60-70 hour game. 

Grand Theft Auto III is a massive scale operation that just gets better and better as players dig into it, even though its gets ridiculously difficult at points. But that's the thing, it does get difficult, but the multitude of reasons to keep playing, to feel utterly engaged, perhaps should I say...even addicted...is so powerful that only sleep and my lovely wife could possibly get in the way of an overnighter (or four) with Grand Theft Auto III.",N/A. . ,-,-,9.45,"The game is absolutely, insanely good, and is truly one of the best titles of the year, on PlayStation 2, or on any system.

It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem.

If you have heard of anything about games in the last years, you should have heard of this game, because it's this year's most impressive title, by a long shot.  

Vice City is nearly twice as large as GTA3, including interiors, waterways and airspace, and it clearly delivers a more integrated storyline in the missions, a huge array of vehicles, and some very oddball characters, likeable or not. The game offers an immense landscape that's both vast and detailed, and is backed up by a long list of actors voicing characters, and a handpicked, triple-A '80s soundtrack. 

The game offers some solutions to last year's effort, namely in graphics, control, framerate and streaming technology, though it doesn't succeed in full. Combat control still remains difficult and annoying, framerates drop low often, and there are substantial camera issues, generally revolving around collision detection and clipping. 

But you know what, despite the fact that this game plays a lot like last year's effort, and that it still has its fair share of problems, GTA: Vice City is still one of the most impressive games of 2002, without a doubt.

It has really polished the Bond moments -- which let you be Bond, and that's sort of the point. It has also done a stellar job of matching Hollywood's production values, and for a license like this I think that's hugely important. Everything or Nothing is just a medley of solidly-executed gameplay ideas; stealth, explosive driving, shootouts, and huge boss fights come together to make it almost more compelling than some of the most recent movies. I also think that not basing the gameplay on an existing movie has proved highly beneficial, because it's all based on keeping the player entertained, not trying to come up with a way to make moments from the movie entertaining in the interactive realm.

Everything or Nothing's only glaring weakness is that it will not carry on the legacy of fantastic four-player deathmatches that Rare's GoldenEye. It features a more Powerstone-esque four-player deathmatch that has to be unlocked via some skilled cooperative play. Speaking of which, I think cooperative is a nice inclusion, but it was clear that it was still rushed. It's fun, but if EA wants to make a go of it, it's going to need the same attention that single-player got.

All said and done, I absolutely recommend Everything or Nothing for the single-player experience, which will last most players around 10 hours, and go as high as 20 depending on how much time you spend on earning platinum medals. There's also a pretty cool arcade and survival mode set in a VR training level to extend gameplay after you beat it.

Give third-person Bond a chance. This is a really excellent first-step towards making it something really special, and I can guarantee you we'll be seeing more of it in the near future.",N/A. . ,-,-,8.65,Everything or Nothing is just a medley of solidly-executed gameplay ideas.

The list of events seem neverending, but what it all boils down to is some entertaining rhythm racing, motion-controlled tricking akin to the likes of SSX Blur, and some fun departures from classic MX heat racing in free ride, racing challenges, and the always-awesome ski jump events.  It’s obvious that Untamed for Wii wasn’t THQ’s highest priority though, as Incinerator hasn’t performed at the level that Rainbow studios was made famous for, and we’d hope that publisher THQ realizes the potential of Wii and focuses on an exclusive experience for this generation’s best selling console.

Wii isn’t just about being casual-friendly, and Heroes 2 gets that.

Rather than shoving something simple and thrown together onto a successful console, teams need to step up and put in the extra effort and fine-tuning that it takes to make something that really works on Wii.

Games developed in this manner have a tendency to show barely-tweaked visuals and tacked on controls, but Vanguard looks notably sharper and plays significantly better on Nintendo's system. I've scored it lower than our sister site, though, because Wii is simply capable of so much more. Vanguard arrives on PS2 at the end of its life cycle, but it comes to Wii at the beginning and it barely scratches the surface of what's really possible.

Even with that being true, Vanguard is fun and pretty wartime first-person shooter on Nintendo's Wii and If you played Call of Duty 3 and want something more atmospheric, this is your game. Its overall presentation is much better and the resulting experience much more engaging. Plus, it's got a decent four-player compatible multiplayer mode, which CoD lacked completely. 

But Vanguard's controls, while adequate, are looser than Activision's shooter, which is a disappointment. The developer has almost made up for the less desirable responsiveness with a host of control intricacies, from an analog lean in sights mode to a quick 180 turn and a sprint option and they're all welcomed additions. And yet, none of them mask that basic control shortcoming entirely.

If you can live with it, and I suspect many can, you will undoubtedly find Vanguard to be an entertaining and intense first-person shooter. For me, this is just the beginning of better games to come. I don't want to choose between tight controls or good graphics. I expect them both.","Gameplay is decent, if unremarkable. It's another WWII FPS.

Definitely.  Much like Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, ZX takes the familiar gameplay and visual prowess of its predecessors and bumps it up one notch higher, though we do have to say with only the slightest amount of criticism, that ZX isn’t quite the homecoming we were expecting.  The visuals are amazing, and the gameplay is still just as tight and responsive as it has been over the years, but a few beats were missed when moving onto the DS.  A better use of the bottom screen is simply essential to the sequel (and you better believe we want one), and a bit more overall production value is definitely needed to really set this game apart from the Zero titles before it.  At the same time, we’d be crazy not to recommend Mega Man ZX to fans of any age and skill level, as it is truly the next step in the Mega Man franchise.  The gameplay has never been better, the attitude is there, and the addition of new playable X units simply rocks.  If you’re a fan of the franchise, or are wondering if ZX is a good time to jump into the world of Mega Man, don’t hesitate to pick this one up.  Like the first Mega Man Zero on GBA, however, Mega Man ZX gets the job done on all accounts, but leaves room for improvement for versions to follow.",Multiple Model X forms offer a variety of play styles.

To this day, fans of the franchise debate whether or not 2 or 3 is the best in the series -- to me, the point is moot. Both are incredible, and both can be owned for a combined total of just ten bucks. You should download both.

But it is important to assert that Mega Man 3 fully deserves the praise that fans continue to offer it to this day. Series creator Keiji Inafune seems to have recently taken a stance against the game, regretting some of its innovations -- the new Mega Man 9 was intentionally created in the style of 1 and 2 for example, leaving out mechanics like the slide technique first seen here. But though it is true that several of the later Mega Man sequels were just quick, cookie-cutter cash-ins, the franchise had not yet sunk to those depths by 1990. Mega Man 3 is excellent, the endless debate over whether it or 2 is the best sequel is a valid one, and you should spend the digital cash to jump into the experience and discover its quality for yourself. Mr. Inafune, I respectfully disagree with any reservations you have about this title. It rocks, and its arrival on the Virtual Console makes it still a good time to be a fan of Mega Man.",-,-,-,9.5,"Mega Man 3 is an excellent, fully featured and incredibly enjoyable action experience from the NES.

And all of the 8-bit Mega Man games, on their own, are awesome experiences. If you've got the cash, I recommend the whole set -- there are six on sale in the Wii Shop right now, and each one's worth your Points.

To rank my recommendation and give some priority to your purchasing though, I will land on the opinion that out of the six now on sale in the Wii Shop, Mega Man's fourth adventure is probably the fifth best.

This long-anticipated sequel to what I consider to be one of the greatest games ever made arrives as one hell of a great new installment to an already-outstanding franchise.

Echoes isn't exactly a groundbreaking product. The feeling of originality, of freshness, that overwhelmed me as I played through Prime is not present in this sequel, and that's mainly because Prime 2 doesn't stray from the winning formula. It strictly adheres to it, in fact. That's a little disappointing. But at the same time the end experience is every bit as amazing as the first, which means that if you loved the original game then you're going to love this one too. And if you hated it, well, you're probably not going to have a sudden change of heart now.

Prime 2 succeeds because it successfully recreates the Metroid experience in 3D. It succeeds for all the same reasons that the first did, and no new ones. The wide-openness of the huge, gorgeous world. The gargantuan number of hidden upgrades that promise access to areas unreachable. The intense boss fights. The intuitive first-person platforming elements and the challenging third-person environmental puzzles. And most of all, the exploration factor. Just getting to know the world is immensely enjoyable and extremely rewarding. Did I mention that the game is artistically and technically head and shoulders above most games on the market, competing systems included?

I have a couple of minor quibbles with the Echoes. The Dark World is less compelling than the Light World. The lock-on system is not without problems. A dual-analog control setup is long overdue, at least as a secondary option for those who might prefer it. And at least one boss fight was made unfairly more difficult due to the lack of a nearby save point.

But everything said and done, this is still one of the best games to come out in the last couple years and in many ways it stands side-by-side with Metroid Prime. Some gamers may actually prefer it.

And what it boils down to is this: if you're okay with Echoes being an extension of the first game and not a revolution, you're going to flip out over this sequel.

Our highest recommendation.","A superb first-person adventure in an alien world.. Inventive new applications of winning gameplay.. An extremely lengthy, rewarding adventure.. Some of the best graphics on the GameCube.. Multiplayer is a little bland.. One late-game sequence may be tough for casual players.. ",-,-,9.3,"Echoes isn't exactly a groundbreaking product.

the year-long delay has been very much worth the wait. Call it a first-
person shooter or a first-person adventure -- doesn't matter. I call it 
the best game on Nintendo's console. It is clear from the moment you 
pick up the controller that Prime 3 was developed exclusively for Wii. 
Not only do the new controls respond quicker and with more precision 
than any dual-analog-helmed FPS ever created, but the gesture system 
works brilliantly, too. Meanwhile, the title delivers everything a Metroid 
fan could hope for, including spectacular environmental puzzles, epic 
boss fights and intense combat, all wrapped up in a package that 
spans multiple worlds and is filled with re-traversal exploration. A 
cinematic storyline made possible by beautiful art and graphics rounds 
out the experience, which is complemented by a medal system and 
WiiConnect24 compatibility. 

There are a couple of minor quibbles that keep Prime 3 from a higher 
score. The first and most obvious is that the game is a sequel and thus 
inherently feels familiar. While Corruption features more variety than 
any of its predecessors, it's not the design revolution that the original 
game was. Also, as you explore the world, you will occasionally 
encounter doorways that take longer than they should to open, as they 
are loading the next area. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence, but it 
does occur. And finally, while the majority of the 20-hour experience 
flows, there's one fetch quest that interrupts the pace.

We rated the original Metroid Prime a 9.8 on GameCube and had 
Corruption been the first game in the series it'd have been worthy of 
the same score. As it stands, Samus Aran's latest adventure is a 
spectacular must-own experience and one of Wii's defining games. 
Stop reading and buy it.",Fantastic environmental puzzles are among the best of the series. Great boss fights require you to use every game mechanic at your disposal. Atmospheric levels are a pleasure to explore. Various gameplay elements mesh nicely into a seamless whole. Some of the contextual actions don't control all that well. Streamlined controls make things a little too easy and a little less adventurous. Doesn't do much different than the previous two Metroid Prime games. ,-,-,9.0,"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was originally set to launch with Wii, but a year-long delay has been very much worth the wait.

So what's the catch? Actually, there's just one, and it's obvious: If you've played all these games before, you'll find some fabulous enhancements waiting, but the actual content is still roughly the same. You'll have to decide if the special edition set and the promise of new widescreen modes and Wii controls for the first two titles in the series is enough for you. For me, there's no question that the compilation is worth every penny.
 
If, by some lucky twist of fate, you fall into the category of Wii owners who have never played any of the Prime games before, Nintendo has with Trilogy delivered you a box set of holy proportions. For a bargain price, you will receive 80-plus hours of the best adventuring found on any home consoles in a decade. And the craziest part is that Retro's artists are so good that the Prime titles they released back in 2002 still look better than the majority of Wii efforts.

My brother and I, at the age of about seven, spent weeks and months questing through the password-enabled adventure. It had a certain charm to it, and even if I couldn't describe it then it made an impact on me. Then along came Super Metroid in 1994, and I was totally blown away by how brilliant it was. It was a perfect videogame in my mind. It was edgy, home to a fantastic power-up system, full of awesome bosses, and the gameplay style was a soul mate to me.  

Needless to say, I have an unhealthy obsession with the franchise. So, when Metroid Prime was finally announced I was both thrilled and frightened to see how it would turn out. But after several years of very hard work, Retro Studios and Nintendo have translated the same genius of Super Metroid into 3D with very few casualties. Because of that, Metroid Prime has not only become my most beloved title on GameCube, but also one of my most treasured games of all time. I'm not sure where I place it, but it's very high on the list. 

If I had to make one personal observation, it would be that the change to first-person perspective was brilliant for its move to 3D, but not perfect. I felt comfortable (even in awe) 90% of the time, but there are a few boss fights where it can frustrate. It's extremely rare, but something you should be aware of going into it. It's nothing that sours the overall quality, though. 

That said, I would recommend Metroid Prime as an absolute buy -- skip the renting facade -- for every owner of a GameCube. It's a real collector's item. You'll want to keep this one even after your done spending 30+ hours with it. (By the way, please note that Prime's timer does not count down when you're looking at the map, reading scan data, examining your research log, or viewing cut-scenes. So, while your clock my read closer to 20 hours at completion, you will have in fact played much more.) 

The only reason one would avoid it is if action/adventures are not part of your narrower taste in games. If you fall into that category, you have no idea what you're missing out on.

You can find videos of the subculture scattered on YouTube and similar sites, and watch as players try over and over to get through seemingly impossible side-scrolling challenges.

Compared to the Mario we Americans know and love, The Lost Levels feels a lot like a fan-made hack – with platforming challenges that are just a bit too frustrating and don't flow as well as Mario 1, and graphics that seem like a downgrade as well. But, odd as it is, this is the real, actual follow-up to Super Mario Bros. the way it was intended to be.

It's absolutely worth 600 of your Wii Points to experience it, and Luigi's alternate controls, and the near-maddening new vision of the Mushroom Kingdom for the very first time. Just prepare yourself for repeated trips to the Game Over screen, because it turns out that NOA made the right choice after all, over 20 years ago, in holding this one back.","If you want a tough Super Mario Bros., here you go.

Though we would have loved to see a little something extra thrown in for this release, it's difficult to argue against Nintendo's standing policy of just releasing games just as they were when they first arrived – and Mario's third adventure still stands well enough on its own to firmly recommend it for download even with its old graphical quirks still in place. The only reasons you shouldn't already be walking to your Wii to launch the Shop and put down your 500 points would be if you're happy with a version of the game you already own, like the 2003 Game Boy Advance re-release, or if you're holding out hope that the visually enhanced Super Mario All-Stars edition will someday arrive as a downloadable option as well.

played, Wii's best game, and an absolute must-own experience. And to 
me, this odd trek through space really does feel like the true sequel to 
Mario 64. It harkens back to the N64 classic with nostalgic faces and 
places from the Mushroom Kingdom, but it also re-invents the 
franchise with new space-themed mechanics and fresh Wii-enhanced 
controls. It is, as I have said since I first played it, a near-perfect 
combination of old platforming values and new design.

Expect to be blown away by the fantastic level challenges and galactic 
variety. Expect to be blown away by the addictive gravity effects -- you 
will jump off ledges just to see if you can rotate all the way around a 
structure. And expect to be blown away by the tight controls and 
beautiful graphics. 

Galaxy isn't quite perfect. There are some minor issues -- tiny 
blemishes, if you will, hiding on the backside of a supermodel. There's 
the auto-camera, which works exceptionally well most of the time, but 
every so often stumbles. And there's the overall difficulty -- a little too 
easy to 60 stars and to defeat bosses for my tastes. But even with these 
potential drawbacks, Nintendo's Tokyo studio has created a platformer 
that deserves its place among the very best and will surely be 
remembered in another decade as a classic.","Some of the best level designs of any 3D platformer. Beautiful, colorful graphics. Controls work just about flawlessly in nearly every situation.

Leading up to the game's release I hadn't expected much more than simply ""more of the same."" I loved the original Super Mario Galaxy, but the company would have to do something pretty special to really wow me.

Consider me wowed. Again. Yes, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is more of what made the original so amazingly good: brilliant gravity platforming. Incredibly tight and responsive controls.

New level challenges, new gameplay mechanics, new (and incredible) orchestral pieces. All done up in a package that streamlines the classic Mario experience: a straightforward presentation, a much more intelligent camera system, and a rewarding progression that opens up some seriously devious and fulfilling level challenges.

Mario has always been a universally appealing game design and Nintendo has done an incredible job to make sure its key franchise is just as accessible to gamers of all walks of life. Most of all, Super Mario Galaxy 2 perfectly captures that classic videogame charm, the reason why most of us got into gaming from the start.","Levels have tons of different objectives, all of them fun.

Where each of the N64, Cube and Wii installments of the series have focused on multiplayer, more characters and more crazy items, though, this SNES original keeps things simpler -- emphasizing, instead, the actual racing instead of the combat within each race.

So stick with the other Kart games if you want the multiplayer chaos, but come on back to this very first racing adventure with Mario and his crew.

The House of the Dead: Overkill blends some great gameplay with an impressive style, some great humor, and enough violence and vulgarity to confuse the hell out of soccer moms looking for a new Sims game or Petz title.  I wouldn’t put the overall production value or difficulty up there with WoW’s offerings just yet, but for a relaunch of the series on Wii, Overkill is off to a very nice start.  A few technical hitches can be found, and it’s obvious that the team had its hands full trying to get this one out the door with as much as possible, but even more polish and refinement in the future could do wonders for the series on Wii.  The characters are great, the story is just outlandish enough for us to plop it right in there along with Dead Alive, Evil Dead, or They Live, though the profanity could be toned down a bit, used only when it feels natural instead of nearly every line of dialogue.  As far as on-rails shooters go on Wii, Overkill sits at the top of the pile.  When it comes to The House of the Dead overall, I’d say HOTD2 and the most recent HOTD4 still take the cake, though it’s obvious Headstrong games has what it takes to hang with the big boys.  Buy this awesome addition to Wii’s hardcore library en mass, so we can all get another dose of Dead on Wii ASAP.

But if you can satisfy this title's steep multiplayer requirements (three friends with three GBAs and GBA cables), you're in for a real treat. Four Swords Adventures is really the perfect multiplayer complement to the existing Zelda titles -- and a must-have for die-hard fans of the franchise. Whether it's bumping into familiar enemies and characters from virtually every game in the series (including Wind Waker) or the huge collection of recognizable tunes, Four Swords Adventures has got fan service written all over it. Everything that makes the hearts of would-be Links beat higher is here. You will swim, you will dive, you will hide from giant bombs, you will climb Death Mountain and forage into the Lost Woods, you will jump, shoot, and slash, you will toss your tools into a fairy well (and I mean this literally -- this isn't some dirty euphemism), you will curse at a Tektite and get swallowed whole, you will cut grass and burn it, Hurricane-spin and sword beam, push and pull, lift and hammer down, run and slam, ride a horse, squint in the dark, run from Floormasters, and you will fight more enemies at once than ever before. And there will be chickens. Lots of chickens. There are many special moments for returning Zelda players in particular, such as when floor tiles start to spin and come flying at you. ""Don't worry, I know how to do this,"" the expert is bound to say. Then the game will suddenly start hurling other pieces of the level at the stunned group as well, and everyone is on a level playing field again¿

Without an overworld to tie the entire experience together, Four Swords Adventures feels a bit more episodic than previous games in the series, but even so, there are so many memorable moments that it's easy to forgive the simpler setup. Unlike RPGs like Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath, this isn't about item variety, barter, and stats building. Four Swords is one devilishly laid out collection of puzzles after the next, bolstered by some good, old-fashioned action. It would have been nice if the technical side of the game would gave been more up to par. Polygonal levels and characters in the vein of the two aforementioned RPGs or would have gone a long way, even if the disconnect between the GameCube and GBA presentation would have been larger. Or, at the very least, the developers could have spared us the blurred sprite close-ups. But even with these limitations, Four Swords Adventures remains a shining example of connectivity done right. It succeeds where Crystal Chronicles failed, providing a solid reason as to why four player should go through all the trouble of hooking up four GBAs to their GameCube. Some things are meant to be for your eyes only -- and in the absence of online gaming on the platform, this is the way to do it.

Even slowly making your way through the overworld by way of set clues, rather than the kind of self-directed navigation we were allowed in A Link Between Worlds, felt old-fashioned. And yet, as I potter once again across Koholint, digging up its last remaining secrets to avoid turning it off again, I’m delighted to have been wrong. Link’s Awakening retains the style and feel of its 1993 self, but looks and controls like a game – albeit a retro-styled one –  made in 2019.

Ever since Link to the Past, I have been waiting for another adventure with the same sense of freedom and interactivity. Although games like Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, and Metroid filled the void, I had to wait six years for Zelda's jump to a next generation console. The wait was very well worth it. Ocarina of Time is easily the best in the series. Sure, the game has a couple of little flaws (the annoying Navi ""hey"" messages, for example) -- but unlike the hundreds and hundreds of uninspired gaming sequels that find their way into console and PC owners' homes every year, Ocarina of Time takes some basic gameplay and story ideas from its predecessors and rolls them into a completely unique experience. 

I don't know how many games I have played in my life where you see some cool scenery in the background and you're thinking ""wow, wouldn't it be great if you could actually go there?"" That's what Zelda is all about. You see something and you're thinking ""wouldn't it be cool if you could..."" -- and you can. The fighting system is fantastic, the new camera system unlike anything you have ever seen. Apart from a little slowdown and a few blurry textures here and there, the graphics are insanely beautiful. The sunsets and rain sequences, the projectile and smoke effects, everything is displayed in vibrant colors and with much attention to detail. Although the lack of the overworld theme is a bummer, the many returning Zelda melodies (such as the glissando announcing a secret or the fanfare when finding an item) and the moody dungeon scores are only outdone by the amazing surround ambient effects.

In the gameplay department, the gap between Nintendo's in-house development and third party titles becomes painfully clear. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time should be recommended playing for ever aspiring videogame designer and programmer out there. If you're making games and you haven't played this game, then you're like a director who has never seen Citizen Kane or a musician who has never heard of Mozart. If you're a gamer looking for your next title to buy, then take it from me, this is as good as it's going to get for a looooong time.

A break-through title from Nintendo that deserves all the hype and praise it's gotten. The limited gold edition is just the icing on the cake. My highest possible recommendation.",-,-,-,10.0,"The fighting system is fantastic, the new camera system unlike anything you have ever seen.

Nintendo went for a more casual approach this time around, keeping the amount of hardcore dungeon-crawling to a minimum, and shedding the traditional control scheme for a more casual-friendly approach. But with that being said, Phantom Hourglass is still an extremely ambitious, entertaining, and innovative product.  Hardcore Zelda fans will find this to be an easier experience than previous handheld efforts, but when looking at the total package it's easy to see that amidst the ""classic vs. touch"" arguments and ""hardcore vs. casual"" debates that will undoubtedly arise, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is truly an amazing product worthy of praise.  The music is impressive, visual style unrivaled on DS at this point, item design truly innovative, and boss work nothing short of genius.  The game will run hardcore gamers just over 15 hours, with side quests adding an additional five or so on top of it, but more than the sheer length of the game is the fact that Nintendo managed to take the entire world inspired by Wind Waker, shrink it down, and deliver the same living-world experience in a pocket adventure, and it's simply fun to sail, interact in the world, and seek out all the little things that round off the experience.  

It comes down to this:  Great games are made up of a series of truly captivating moments.  A Link to the Past had the unveiling of the master sword, Ocarina of Time hooked gamers with the simplicity and entertainment of riding the Hyrule countryside with Epona for the very first time, and Twilight Princess astonished loyal Zelda fans as they witnessed their hero change forms in the midst of the twilight.  The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass has those moments too, and while it may be more casual than we'd like, it's captivating, entertaining, and a true adventure worthy of the Zelda name.  It's different, but it's still the real deal.",Gorgeous visuals. Touch-screen controls work wonderfully. Lots of nifty puzzles to solve. Great boss fights. A few pacing problems make certain sections of the game a bit of a drag.

It is also one of the finest games I have ever played. The experience is made better and not worse on Wii. The Wii remote and nunchuk add accuracy and speed to exploration and combat for a heightened sense of immersion. While the game has just about everything going for it, including improved controls, a long and engrossing quest, brain-teasing dungeons and some beautiful graphics, it's not perfect. The difficulty has been upped over Wind Waker, but I wish it were harder still -- the boss fights are oftentimes too easy, for example. Additionally, while the visuals are generally impressive, some textures remain blurry to the point they are noticeable. And finally, I still question why Nintendo refuses to add either voice work to the side characters (especially since Twilight Princess features such an improved, dark storyline) or orchestrated music to the soundtrack.

Nintendo's new console ships with Wii Sports, which effectively demonstrates a new breed of games only possible on Wii. The Zelda franchise is equally exclusive to the machine and Twilight Princess is must-see, must-play and must-own entry into the series that proves over and over again why Nintendo is the best developer in the world.","Compelling characters and story. outstanding world and puzzle design. longer than most action adventure games. terrific graphics, from an artistic perspective.

The lack of pizzazz, unfortunately, won't do anything for either camp.

Still, EndWar offers something new, refreshing, and a little exciting for console players. It's sort of a coming of age when what could be seen as the last stalwart of the PC -- the RTS -- is made from the ground up with every classic convention put on the chopping block to please the couch player.

port of the previously released PlayStation 2 affair that also happens to 
be good fun at its best and frustrating at its worst. Croft controls and 
looks better than she ever has before and yet she still has a long way to 
go if she's to provide real competition to the Prince of Persia, who has, 
in my mind, out-Tomb Raidered Tomb Raider in recent years. The Wii 
control additions really do add to the experience and the game looks 
pretty good, too. The end product is not exemplary, but it is a step in 
the right direction and it's also entertaining, particularly when you're 
jumping from ledge to ledge or swinging across chasms to the beat of 
moody music.  

Although I think it's just as good as previous versions of Anniversary, 
I've lowered the score of the game on Wii because little effort has been 
made to capitalize on the added horsepower of Nintendo's console. 
That the framerate regularly suffers in wide-open levels is really 
disappointing. I wouldn't call it a deal breaker, but an unfortunate 
oversight.","Strikes a balance between homage and new, exciting content. Acrobatic action adventure gameplay is challenging without being frustrating. Lara looks great and moves effortlessly.

Activision is out to capture the casual Wii market on DS, adding in a motion pack along with two very sub-par games in an attempt to use Tony Hawk’s brand, and the “two for one” double pack strategy to push units this holiday season.  It fails as a game, but only time will tell if it fails as a marketing plan, since – let’s face it – not everyone out there buying games knows a lemon when they see one.

Activision’s motion pack works.  The Tony Hawk brand works.  Aiming DS products to casual users works.  But it doesn’t work like this, and what could have been a great title to push new tech (an ambitious move has been made by Activision to try and expand Nintendo’s own expanded marketplace) with a fully-funded, legit contender against other DS titles is instead more or less a shovelware design with an interesting piece of tech included.  A full-fledged, AAA effort with the motion pack at its side could be a great piece of product.  Tony Hawk’s Motion, on the other hand, is a lacking package that players would do well to ignore; especially since the DSi (and lack of GBA port for the new motion pack) is on its way in a matter of months.",-,-,-,4.5,"Activision is out to capture the casual Wii market on DS, adding in a motion pack along with two very sub-par games in an attempt to use Tony Hawk’s brand.

What serious Hawk fan wouldn't be willing to buy a game once and keep upgrading it with new levels, for a small fee even, for months to come? In the end, the Tony Hawk series' biggest drawback is that number 4 is facing strong competition from number 3 on the Xbox. 

Hawk 4 is the best the series has to offer, but if you picked up Hawk 3 anytime in the last six months, then I wouldn't be in any hurry to rush out and pay full price for this game at this time.

This doesn’t mean that the Tony Hawk franchise is at an end. Far from it. The addictiveness is still there. Despite its flaws and some of its recurring bugs, it’s hard not to enjoy playing Tony Hawk’s Project 8.

There is almost unlimited potential for Tony Hawk with next-gen software, but Neversoft needs to think a bit more out of the box. I’m not talking about bringing us back to the dark days of THUG, but why not take a cue from Amped 2 and meld the single-player world with online play? Or give us back the joy of playing the main mode as a variety of skating pros and building them into giants of the industry? Or why not take us through Tony Hawk’s career from young pioneer to king of the sport? Heck, I’d be happy to see Tony Hawk 2 re-imagined for the new generation.
