The website app recieves a ZIP-file extracted from any whatsapp chat and analyses its data for each participant of the group.

### Participant Breakdownüîç

- Shows **when they are most active**.
- Counts the **total messages sent** by each user.

## Technologies Used: üõ†Ô∏è
- Python & Pandas library
- Flask web-framework
- HTML, CSS

### How it works
1. **User Uploads a WhatsApp Chat**  
   - The user exports a **ZIP file** from WhatsApp and uploads it to the website.  

2. **Client-Side Processing**  
   - The ZIP file is **extracted** in the browser.  
   - The **chat text file** inside is opened, and the raw text is sent to the backend.  

3. **Backend Processing (Flask & Pandas)**  
   - The raw chat text is **converted into a Pandas DataFrame**, with each row representing a message.  
   - Special characters and irrelevant data are cleaned.  

4. **Data Analysis & AI Insights**  
   - The processed DataFrame is ready for analysis.  
   - Insights are generated based on **user requests** (e.g., participant activity, chat analysis, favorite words).
   - AI requests are handled using Groq API and carefully designed prompts for accurate responses.

## Usage:
### Option 1- Local:
1. Download the repository.
2. Install requirements.txt.
3. Remove # from row 6.
4. Add .env to project folder with GROQ_API_KEY = 'api-key'.
5. Run app.py file.
6. Open http://127.0.0.1:5001.
